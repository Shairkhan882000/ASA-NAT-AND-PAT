# ASA-NAT-AND-PAT
ASA NAT translates private IP addresses to different internal or public addresses for secure inbound or outbound communication. ASA PAT allows many internal hosts to share a single public IP by assigning unique port numbers, enabling scalable internet access while conserving IP space and maintaining secure stateful translations.
